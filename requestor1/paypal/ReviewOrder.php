<?php

/********************************************
ReviewOrder.php

This file is called after the user clicks on a button during
the checkout process to use PayPal's Express Checkout. The
user logs in to their PayPal account.

This file is called twice.

On the first pass, the code executes the if statement:

if (! isset ($token))

The code collects transaction parameters from the form
displayed by SetExpressCheckout.html then constructs and
sends a SetExpressCheckout request string to the PayPal
server. The paymentType variable becomes the PAYMENTACTION
parameter of the request string. The RETURNURL parameter
is set to this file; this is how ReviewOrder.php is called
twice.

On the second pass, the code executes the else statement.

On the first pass, the buyer completed the authorization in
their PayPal account; now the code gets the payer details
by sending a GetExpressCheckoutDetails request to the PayPal
server. Then the code calls GetExpressCheckoutDetails.php.

Note: Be sure to check the value of PAYPAL_URL. The buyer is
sent to this URL to authorize payment with their PayPal
account. For testing purposes, this should be set to the
PayPal sandbox.

Called by SetExpressCheckout.html.

Calls GetExpressCheckoutDetails.php, CallerService.php,
and APIError.php.
